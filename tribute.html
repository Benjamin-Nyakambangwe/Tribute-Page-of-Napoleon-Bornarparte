	<h2>Napoleon Bornaparte's life Timeline:</h2>
	<h1>1769</h1>
	<p>Napoleon is born on the Island of Corsica</p>
	<h1>1796-97</h1>
	<p>Italian Campaign.  Napoleon took over the French “Army of Italy,” drove the Austrians and Sardinians out of Piedmont, defeated the Papal States, and occupied Venice.  This was his first major victory.</p>
	<h1>1799</h1>
	<p>Coup d’état that established Napoleon as First Consul of France, part of a triumvirate that included Cambacérès and Lebrun.  Although the plan was for the three to have equal power, Napoleon quickly became the most powerful.</p>
	<h1>1804</h1>
	<p>Napoleon proclaimed himself Emperor.</p>
	<h1>1805</h1>
	<p>Battle of Austerlitz, where Napoleon defeated the Third Coalition (actually the first coalition mounted against him, rather than against the Revolutionary troops.)  Generally viewed as one of his most brilliant battles, the Battle of Austerlitz was fought in what is now the Czech Republic, with Napoleon trouncing the armies of the Austrian and Russian Empires.  </p>
	<h1>1807</h1>
	<p>Treaty of Tilsit.  After the battle of Friedland, where Napoleon defeated the Russians, Alexander of Russia negotiated this treaty that would bring peace to Russia.  They met on a raft in the middle of the Niemen River to sign the treaty, which had both a public and a private part.  In the public part, Russia ceded 50% of Prussian territory to France; in the private part, Alexander agreed that if the British continued the war against France, Russia would join the Continental System of blockades whose goal it was to isolate Britain economically.  The result of the treaty was a major realignment of alliances.</p>
	<h1>1812</h1>
	<p>Russian Campaign.  Napoleon amassed a huge army and marched to Moscow, not recognizing the challenges of supplying a large army such a long way from home.  As the Russian army retreated, they applied a “scorched earth” policy, destroying or carrying off anything that might be useful.  As they retreated from Moscow, they set it on fire.  Napoleon had counted on billeting his troops in the city during the long Russian winter, but no shelter was left standing.  As a result, the French army suffered terribly from starvation and cold as they made the long trip back towards France. </p>
	<h1>1813</h1>
	<p>German Campaign.  Napoleon’s army regrouped in German territory, and battled the Coalition successfully in several locations before suffering a decisive defeat in the Battle of the Nations (Leipzig) at the hands of Germany’s General Blucher.</p>
	<h1>1814</h1>
	<p>Napoleon abdicated as emperor, and was sent into exile on the Mediterranean island of Elba.  He was given “sovereignty” over the island, and actually had his own navy.</p>
	<h1>1815</h1>
	<p>Napoleon escaped from Elba, landing in southern France and marching towards Paris, gathering an army around him as he went. </p> <br>
	<p>The Champ-de-Mai parade and ceremony in Paris reaffirmed Napoleon as Emperor and forced everyone to swear allegiance to him and to the Acte Additional.  The Acte was a set of small reforms that disappointed his supporters, to whom he had promised a less dictatorial government. </p><br>
	<p>Losing support at home, Napoleon turned to the battlefield where he faced the largest Coalition army yet.  His forces were defeated, and he escaped to Fontainebleau. </p><br>
	<p>Napoleon abdicated a second time, and attempted to escape to the United States.  He was captured by the British and eventually transported to the island of St. Helena, where he remained for the rest of his life.</p>
	<h1>1821</h1>
	<p>Napoleon died on St. Helena</p>

	<h2>Who was Napoleon</h2>
	<p>Napoléon Bonaparte (15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821) was a French statesman and military leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the French Revolutionary Wars. As Napoleon, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again briefly in 1815 during the Hundred Days. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. He is considered one of the greatest commanders in history, and his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has endured as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history.</p>
